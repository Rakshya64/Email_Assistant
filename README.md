## Contributing Rules

We welcome contributions to the **Email Assistant with AI** project!
Please follow these rules to maintain consistency and ensure a smooth workflow:

---

### 1. Always Pull Before Starting
- Pull the latest changes from the `main` branch before starting any new work:
  ```bash
  git pull origin main
  ```

---

### 2. Create a New Branch for Each Feature
- Use the following naming convention for branches:  
  ```
  <your-initials><FeatureName><MonthAbbreviation><Day>
  ```
  Example:
  - For "Rakshya Niraula" adding email filtering on December 6th:
    ```
    rnAddEmailFilterDec06
    ```

---

### 3. Resolve Conflicts Locally
- Handle any merge conflicts on your local machine rather than on GitHub's web interface.

---

### 4. Never Commit Directly to `main`
- The `main` branch is protected. Always work on a separate branch and submit a pull request (PR) for review.

---

### 5. Managing Dependencies with `pip freeze`
- If you install a new package, make sure to update the `requirements.txt` file to reflect the changes:
  ```bash
  pip freeze > requirements.txt
  ```
- This ensures that all contributors can install the same dependencies by running:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Always check in the updated `requirements.txt` as part of your commit.

---


### 6. Naming Conventions
- **File Names**: Use **PascalCasing** (e.g., `EmailHandler.py`).  
- **Template & Static Files**: Use **snake_case** (e.g., `user_profile.html`, `email_styles.css`).  
- **Variables and Functions**: Use **snake_case** (e.g., `process_email()`).

---

### 7. Testing and Debugging
- Before submitting a pull request:
  - Test your code locally using `pytest` or Flask's test client.
  - Debug any issues to ensure your changes work as expected.
  - Avoid pushing broken or half-completed code.

---

### 8. Submit a Pull Request
- Submit a PR to the `main` branch with a clear title and description of your changes.
- Tag a team member for review.

By following these rules, we can ensure that our project stays clean, efficient, and collaborative. Thank you for contributing! ðŸ˜Š
